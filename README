PROJECT		- instructions for using these parsers and 
		  building your projects.

MDL.spec	- The entire languange specification.

matrix.c	- stripped down matrix code (new_matrix, free_matrix,
matrix.h	  print_matrix, and identity_matrix).

parser.h	- structures and definitions used by the parser.
		  This defines the command array that the parser fills.

symtab.h	- Symbol table routines. Structures are defined as well as
symtab.c	  add_symbol, lookup_symbol, set_value, and utility
		  symbol table printing routines.

print_pcode.c	- Contains print_pcode. A routine that will print out
		  the arry of commands that the parser fills. This
		  is for testing and debugging purposes.

test		- A sample script

mdl.l		- Flex (lex) source file. Flex will use this file to build
		  the lexical scanner.

mdl.y		- Bison (yacc) source file. Bison will use this file to
		  build the parser. This file also holds main(), but
		  you can change that.

Makefile	- The project Makefile
